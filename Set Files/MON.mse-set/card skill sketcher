	rule_text:
		Whenever a player casts an instant or sorcery spell from their hand, you may exile that card as it resolves instead of putting it anywhere else.
		Whenever <atom-cardname><nospellcheck>Skill Sketcher</nospellcheck></atom-cardname> attacks, you may cast a card exiled with it. That spell costs <sym-auto>X</sym-auto> less to cast, where X is <atom-cardname><nospellcheck>Skill Sketcher</nospellcheck></atom-cardname>’s power.
