To download a set file, replace the SET code in the link
* https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/cajunwritescode/MSEM/tree/main/Set%20Files/SET.mse-set

Unzip the folder to get a Directory Version of the MSE file. You can open the file named "set" in MSE, and Save As to turn it back to a normal .mse-set file if you want.

The data folder contains files that may be needed for MSE files, such as templates and magic-mainframe-extras materials.
